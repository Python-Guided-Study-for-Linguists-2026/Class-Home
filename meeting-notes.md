# Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1 (Jan 22)

### Housekeeping: your Python environment, workflow 
- Create your project folder where you will keep all study materials, python scripts, etc. 
   - Download the "Exercise Files" materials from PyET, unzip there
- Launching Jupyter Lab 
   - Open a terminal, move into your project folder (`cd` is the command, use `TAB` for auto-completion)
   - `jupyter lab` is the command
- Launching Python interpreter shell in your terminal
	- Windows: `python`, Mac: `python3`
	- Make sure to use UP and DOWN arrows to recycle Python commands
	- `control + c` to interrupt a command and return to the prompt (`>>> `)
	- `quit()` to get out 

### How to learn effectively 
- Use **Python shell** and **Jupyter Notebook (JNB)** together
    - Practice in Python shell, then use JNB to make study notes and reference materials for yourself
- Practice frequently: twice a week at the minimum
- Supplement with appropriate sections of Na-Rae's [Python 3 Notes](https://sites.pitt.edu/~naraehan/python3/). Scroll to the bottom for [Text samples](https://sites.pitt.edu/~naraehan/python3/text-samples.txt) link, which has text and code snippets handy for practicing
- Supplement with the [_Think Python_ book](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html): has more problem sets, good for bringing the concepts together


### Course logistics
- GitHub: make an account (use your Pitt email)
- MS Teams: share questions, tips, etc.

### Next week
- PyET Ch.2 Quickstart goes through _all_ essential topics very quickly. Don't worry if you don't fully understand everything. 
- "Code challenge: Factorials" at the end. Give it your best shot.
